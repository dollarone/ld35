IDEAS

anti-tower defense with different shapes - you unlock them as you go along and then use them as you please

basically: here is the map. choose your animals. and you can change throughout

so quick eagles vs mortars and heavy bears vs quick but weak towers

(flames? humans hunting the animals. like spears/traps/catapult/etc)

cons: much much graphics. much level design. story is weak
pros: quite easy gameplay - just choose a shape and (sometimes) a lane. good theme fit. potentially quite fun and original (anti-tower defense)

rabbits, bears, deer, eagles, boars, horses, snakes, mice, buffalo

bow&arrows (dudes in a tower with bows), bomb-towers (throwing rocks in a small radius), catapults, big spear towers, fire towers, water traps (slows you down), bridges that can be blown up


maybe you can change them halfway
-----------

werewolf platformer ala wonder boy in monster land. 

shift into different shapes as you go along. learn new shapes etc. 

Too obvious

----

werewolf in a domestic setting. gameplay perhaps like jones in the fast line with a monthly escapade. 

so basically you are a werewolf trying to get on with life but once a month you end up killing someone

pros: original idea.
cons: perhaps a bit boring. would need cool gfx to be good

---

vampires are shape shifters too! noir gfx where you are a vampire

red/black styled game where you hunt for blood and police/mob hunts for you (once you've committed a crime)

shapeshift? well i guess you can become a bat to get away

----


the metamorphosis 

you wake up and you've turned into a cockroach.

---

some game where you shift the level layout to escape. either by finding a trigger or something more like a rubick's cube
hmm
"shift the shape of the level" ... tenuous

cons: lots of level building. essentially 90% need to be clever or its just easy
pros: a puzzle game. could be clever. OR: a platformer. could be auto-moving. could be the one with the player talking back.
could use lots of plain colours

could be levels where you dont control the character - or freeform where you do. I think you cannot control the player - lest its just a platformer.

so you wanna help some guy get to his home. and he's like "hello uhm" and super british/apologetic and like "uhm dont wanna disturb you but I kinda need to get home" "its my turn to make dinner tonight you know"

"so ehh can you help?" "pleasE?"

"ah shit I'm gonna be late"

game can count time used and number of swaps.

ooh! the intro could be: (in tiny preview)

     xxxxX
     xxxxX
     xxxxX
AAAAABBBBBCCCCCDDDDD
aaaaabbbbBcccccddddd
aaaaabbbbBcccccddddd
     yyyyY
     yyyyY
     yyyyY

press a key to start!
(you cant move the tiles where the player starts and finishes)

pros: cool concept.  could extend to make it mobile
cons: lots of work. make the dynamics. design! the levels (super hard and time consuming) and level loading. make the AI look ahead. suppose it could wait until its done - or just have a GO button. write speech.  do the preview. also it would be so much better if the preview was in 3d (could do that later tho)
and its a platformer :(   (even though its not really it still looks like one)

could make a prototype for the gameplay and see but that could be a big time investment. but if the gameplay works i think there's potential to make it great. although, time. also scared of the level design time sink




screen looks like:

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<                            >
<                            >
<                         __H> [ GO, RONALD, GO ]
<                   _____    >
<             ___            >  2 mins 30 seconds
<      _______               >
<P____                       >  5 moves 
<                            >
 vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

--

shift things to make them pass through things
or morph your player quop style to make him fit shapes
like the japanese tv show
kinda need ragdoll physics tho

---------------

some kinda robot that can change shape to get through bits, e.g. a platformer thing

---

or a car game where you "shift" your "shape" by adding more and more guns
or perhaps the car can become a boat can become a hoovercraft can become a rocket-craft

--

or car game where you can shift the level/map via powerup
--

or a gradus-style power-up shooter where you change as you go along
BOOORING

best ideas: 

anti-tower defense
pros: something i haven't done before
cons: lots of lots of graphics

puzzle-cube-platformer thing
pros: some gfx but could be minimal. puzzle
cons: level design++++. fair amount of work to get a working prototype. gameplay could end up being boring becuase you odnt have a way to see/plan. maaaaybe you can play and see the whole "cube"


OR: i could make the train tracks game!
pros: easy gameplay, tried and tested. "shift the shape of the railroad". can be ported to phones. 
cons: already done, although that was more a proof of concept. perhaps a bit dull. lots of level design. a bit of pixeling if i want it to loook good. i did want to make this bigger. also its not a platformer!
more ideas on that: two trains, trains that start at different times, static tiles (bridges, tunnels), steam from train, platforms, people, coloured trains



todo:

sprites:
character. needs lots of animation if i do speech
house
then the rest could just be red/blue/green/yellow
